/** 
 * This file will include the data contract to the rest of the app about what this directory holds
 * it will include imports (and exports) all components for a single point of access.
 * All components should have named exports
 * Components that consist of complex logic or redux integration can be further de-structured into 
 * “ComponentContainer.js” & “ComponentView.js” as per the “Container-View pattern” 
 * (this will be covered ahead in Design Patterns)
 * TIP: Try to create named-exports instead of default exports for all the components. This will avoid any naming conflicts.
 * 
 * example import { buttonType } from './buttonType.js'
