# TNT App
## Description
TNT App is the is an in house solution to registration for Top Nazarene Talent at Trevecca Nazarene University (TNT) and score/judges sheets for the talent on display at the district level. This app will work in combination with an API/Backend to create a general solution that can be used around other talent competitions but will learn towards this specific event.  The Treveeca Nazarene University event (also know as regional TNT or TNT@TNU) holds events in sports, arts, preaching and bible quizzing.  Each event has different requirements. critera, and results.  Similar to the Olympics where at the end there is a tally and medals and an overall winner, TNT has a point strucure ascribed to each event and result resulting in an overall winner for the large and small divisions (purple and white).  The end result will be a way to keep track of results and feedback for the individual performances, teams, tally a winner, export the results to a pdf at minimum, ideally a power point, and allowing for the exporting of distict level to reigional level.  Future expansion would allow for the customization of the judging critera, turning features on and off to not be so specific to the one competition, and the creation of new event types/competitions.

## Up and running
This app was bootstrapped with create-react-app the following guide comes from there.
### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
